The goal of occluded person re-identification (ReID) is to retrieve specific pedestrians in occluded situations. However, occluded person ReID still suffers from background clutter and low-quality local feature representations, which limits model performance. In our research, we introduce a new framework called PAB-ReID, which is a novel ReID model incorporating part-attention mechanisms to tackle the aforementioned issues effectively. Firstly, we introduce the human parsing label to guide the generation of more accurate human part attention maps. In addition, we propose a fine-grained feature focuser for generating fine-grained human local feature representations while suppressing background interference. Moreover, We also design a part triplet loss to supervise the learning of human local features, which optimizes intra/inter-class distance. We conducted extensive experiments on specialized occlusion and regular ReID datasets, showcasing that our approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.
